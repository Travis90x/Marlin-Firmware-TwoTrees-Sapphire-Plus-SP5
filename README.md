# Marlin-Firmware-TwoTrees-Sapphire-Plus-SP5
This is a non-offical project. 
This repo contains one preconfigured Marlin 2.1.x bugifix fimrware versions for 3D-Printer "TwoTrees Sapphire Plus or SP5".
There are several different revisions of this printer, so you have to choose your Sapphire "Variant" in configuration.h file. 
I will release compiled Firmware for main Versions of it.
The Sapphire Pro (New Name: SP-3) are not supported yet. 
If you've got a Printer: Please feel free to do a pull-request, when your firmware is working.


# Configuration.h

If you have a Stock Variant of Sapphire, you have to edit only few settings.

#define LCD_LANGUAGE XX  (en for english)

You have to choose Sapphire Variant (according to your stepper drivers configuration, and if it has 2 Z_Driver and 2 Z_EndStop)

#define SapphirePlusVariant *
